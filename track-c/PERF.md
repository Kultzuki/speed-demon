# Track C: performance log

## Published reference

The organizers' scoring-box reference takes 14.44 seconds. This is
published calibration, not our own board run.

## First C++ implementation

Scan CSV quote boundaries with memchr. Unescape names only when doubled quotes occur; preserve all significant bytes and trailing spaces. Notes need an exact decoded byte count, not a stored decoded string. Join region IDs through a direct lookup table; missing and out-of-range IDs map to _UNMATCHED. Intern exact names globally and record country membership in bitsets, so distinct counting never relies on a hash alone. Parse and aggregate amounts as signed 64-bit integer cents.

Local full public seed 1: output SHA-256 `d8088b1cd42ba1338b1345b107b55db7b96ef1f5066f3ff64fd26a8912a0f536`.
The direct local process check took 4.3912 seconds on the
Windows/WSL2 laptop with input and output on a Windows bind mount. This single
run includes local process launch and file-sharing overhead and is not an
official timing. It is not comparable to the scoring-box reference.

## Board evidence

No scored C++ board run has been recorded yet. The first implementation is
ready for its initial run; its measured run ID, time, memory, source size,
dependency weight and K will be recorded after the board publishes them.
No speedup is claimed from local timings alone.

## Experiments and correctness

Differential cases include mid-file BOMs, LF inside quoted notes, escaped name/note quotes, empty names, distinct names differing only by spaces, negative sub-unit amounts, unmatched regions and a final record without a newline.
